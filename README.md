Tasks implemented in the project:

Task 1: Add Sessions to a Conference
====================================
- Defined and implemented Session class and SessionForm with the following fields:
Session name
highlights
speaker
duration
typeOfSession
date
start time (in 24 hour notation so it can be ordered).

- Defined and implemented the following Endpoint methods
  - getConferenceSessions(websafeConferenceKey) -- Given a conference, return all sessions
  path: conference/{websafeConferenceKey}/getConferenceSessions

  - getConferenceSessionsByType(websafeConferenceKey, typeOfSession) Given a conference, return all sessions of a specified type (eg lecture, keynote, workshop)
  path: conference/{websafeConferenceKey}/getConferenceSessionsByType/{typeOfSession}

  - getSessionsBySpeaker(speaker) -- Given a speaker, return all sessions given by this particular speaker, across all conferences
  path: conference/{speaker}

  - createSession(SessionForm, websafeConferenceKey) -- open only to the organizer of the conference
    path: conference/{websafeConferenceKey}/createSession


Task 2: Add Sessions to User Wishlist
=====================================
- Defined and implemented the following Endpoints methods

- addSessionToWishlist(SessionKey) -- adds the session to the user's list of sessions they are interested in attending
path: profile/addSessionToWishList
Note: In my design, user would be able to add the same session multiple times to the wish list.
Each time will be saved with a new dateAddedToWishList.

- getSessionsInWishlist() -- query for all the sessions in a conference that the user is interested in
path: profile/getWishList

- deleteSessionInWishlist(SessionKey) -- removes the session from the userâ€™s list of sessions they are interested in attending  
path: profile/deleteSessionFromWishList

Task 3: Work on indexes and queries
=====================================
Implemented 2 endpoint methods for the following queries:
1. Query sessions of a particular Speaker that are less than a given duration
path: sessions/getSessionsBySpeakerlessthan1hourduration

2. Query sessions of a particular type on a particular date
path: sessions/getSessionsOfATypeOnAParticularDate

Also implemented an endpoint method for a query for all non-workshop sessions before 7 pm.
path: sessions/getSessionsNotWorkshopsNotAfter7pm

Task 4: Add a task
=====================================
When a new session is added to a conference, the speaker is checked. If there is more than one session by this speaker at this conference,
then wrote the functionality to add a new Memcache entry that informs of the speaker and other session names

Also defined and implemented endpoint method
- getFeaturedSpeaker()
path: session/featuredspeaker
